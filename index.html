        Cold wind blows on the soles of my feet.
Heaven knows nothing of me.
I'm lost nowhere to go.
Oh when I was a kid oh how magic it seemed.
Oh please let me sleep it's Christmas time.
Flowered winds was where I lived.
Thought you burned not froze for your sins.
Oh I'm so tired and cold.
Oh when I was a kid oh how magic it seemed.
Oh please let me sleep it's Christmas time.
Oh oh when I was a kid oh how magic it seemed.
Oh please let me sleep it's Christmas time.
Oh oh when I if I was a kid oh how magic it seemed.
Oh please let me dream it's Christmas time.

        Now somewhere in the Black Mountain Hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon.
And one day his woman ran off with another guy.
Hit young Rocky in the eye.
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy".
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible.
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival.
His rival it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy.
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy.
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down.
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown".
But Daniel...
